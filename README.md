# pexod-mechanical-design

This repository hosts the [openSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) files for the springed-leg of the Pexod hexapod.

## Visualisation
The content of this folder is only used to generate STL files for visualisation of the robot in a simulator (actually Rviz and Dart). Here the models are adapted for visualisation, mainly meaning some rotations and translations.

## Authors
It was originally designed by Florian Richer, was ported to OpenSCAD and is maintained by Dorian Goepp.
